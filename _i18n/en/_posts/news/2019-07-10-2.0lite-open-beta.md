Galaxy 2.0 open beta started, welcome to try it out.  

Due to most of functions from 1.12 has not port to 1.14, you can see it as vanilla server with multiple world, there will be more function in the future.  
The concept of multiple worlds is still used, but no world border, and the nether and the end are opened.

The goal of this open beta is to test the load and stability of the server cluster. Players are welcome to play in the most brutal way!
