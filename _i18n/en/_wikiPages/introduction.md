## Story

In the far future, interstellar travel has become very popular. Players are travelers from distant planets. They meet other players during the journey and decide to develop the galaxy together...

<hr class="sub">

## Features

The galaxy project uses a multi-world technology to give each player or each group an independent development space. Although the area that can be explored is limited, it also solves the problem of resource grabbing.
Besides, we are also developing a series of new features, new blocks, new tools, weapons, gameplay, and look forward to color game experience in the future.
